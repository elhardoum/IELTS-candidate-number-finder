## IELTS Candidate Number Finder

Forgot your IELTS candidate number and wanted to check your results online? So did I. This is a web extension that should work for Chrome and Firefox at least, helping you find your candidate number to access your scores online.

### Usage

- Download, install and activate the extension
- Navigate to https://ielts.britishcouncil.org/CheckResults.aspx
- Enter all of your details
- Enter a candidate number to start with. Or leave it at `0` to start from there.
- Check "Find my Candidate Number"
- Submit the form.

Now the extension will increment the candidate number every time and check if any results were returned.

Now just sit back and relax. The form will resubmit itself until it finds something, or it breaks.

My candidate number was 3349 so it took a little time of waiting, contributing to that was my slow internet connection, and sometimes slow server response times from the BC website.

### Seems harsh

Yeah, or you can just contact your test center or IELTS support and be done with it.
